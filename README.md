# JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This repository contains my completed projects and exercises as part of my ongoing study and review of core JavaScript concepts, I worked through practical problems that reinforce JavaScript fundamentals, algorithmic thinking, and programming paradigms. Throughout the Summer of 2025, I’ll continue expanding this repository with new challenges, data manipulation tasks, and interactive projects.

🧰 Technologies & Concepts Covered
JavaScript (ES6+)
DOM Manipulation
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Functional Programming
Browser APIs (Local Storage, Fetch API)

🧱 Project Goals
Strengthen understanding of core JavaScript syntax and logic
Practice building reusable functions and data structures
Apply both object-oriented and functional approaches to problem solving
Develop confidence with real-world use of the DOM and APIs
Enhance coding efficiency and debugging skills through algorithmic exercises
