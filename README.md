# JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This repository contains my completed projects and exercises as part of my ongoing study and review of core JavaScript concepts, I worked through practical problems that reinforce JavaScript fundamentals, algorithmic thinking, and programming paradigms. Throughout 2025, Iâ€™ll continue expanding this repository with new challenges, data manipulation tasks, and interactive projects.

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Concepts Covered:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- DOM Manipulation
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional Programming
- Browser APIs (Local Storage, Fetch API)

## ðŸ§± Project Goals:
- Strengthen understanding of core JavaScript syntax and logic
- Practice building reusable functions and data structures
- Apply both object-oriented and functional approaches to problem solving
- Develop confidence with real-world use of the DOM and APIs
- Enhance coding efficiency and debugging skills through algorithmic exercises
